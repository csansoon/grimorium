A companion app for **Blood on the Clocktower** that handles the clockwork so you can focus on the story.

The Grimoire walks you through every phase of the game — role revelation, night actions, day discussion, nominations, voting, and game-over — so you never lose track of what happens next.

**Currently supports:** Trouble Brewing

## Features

- Step-by-step night phase guidance for every role
- Full player state tracking — roles, effects, and abilities
- Handles complex interactions automatically — kills, protections, redirects, and more
- Supports perception and deception mechanics (Recluse, Drunk, Poisoner...)
- Day phase with nominations, voting, and day abilities
- Win condition detection for both core and special conditions
- Works offline as an installable PWA — no internet needed at the table
- English and Spanish localization
